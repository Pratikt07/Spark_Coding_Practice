    Scenario 14: Financial Risk Level Classification for Loan Applicants

    Question Set:
    1. Classify loan applicants as "High Risk" if the loan amount exceeds twice their income and
    credit score is below 600, "Moderate Risk" if the loan amount is between 1-2 times their
    income and credit score between 600-700, and "Low Risk" otherwise. Find the total count of
    each risk level.

    2. For applicants classified as "High Risk," calculate the average loan amount by income range
    (e.g., < 50k, 50-100k, >100k).
    
    3. Group by income brackets (<50k, 50-100k, >100k) and calculate the average credit score for
    each risk level. Filter for groups where average credit score is below 650.
